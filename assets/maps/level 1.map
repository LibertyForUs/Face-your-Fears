# This is a map for Face-your-fears
# The aim is to have a really simple map format, that lets us place objects
# and define behaviour for each level, without needing to hardcode it in. 
# Comments begin with a # character.
# Symbols are defined with an @ sign, and can specify their own characters
# These symbols can either be placed on the map section, or by directly specifying a position:{x,y} value


#Symbols
@dog symbol:& width:158 height:85
@mailbox symbol:= width:52 height:100
@fence symbol:* fixed:true position:{x:-200,z:5.06} collides:false css


# Map placement of symbols. At the moment, comments (#) aren't valid within the placement region
